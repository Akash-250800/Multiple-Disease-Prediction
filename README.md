Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of various diseases (e.g., diabetes, heart disease, etc.) based on patient features like age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc. Machine learning models such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and SVM are trained and evaluated, with the entire application packaged in a Docker container for portability.
Features
Predicts multiple diseases using a single pipeline

Preprocessing and feature engineering for raw medical data

Multiple ML models with performance comparison

Web-based interface (optional, if implemented)

Dockerized for consistent deployment across environments

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python 3.8+

Libraries: 
Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)

Pandas, NumPy (Data Manipulation)

Containerization: Docker

Version Control: Git

Dataset
Source: [Specify dataset source, e.g., Kaggle, UCI, or custom]

Format: CSV with columns like age, bp, cholesterol, disease_label, etc.

Preprocessing: Handled in src/preprocess.py.

Note: Ensure your dataset complies with privacy regulations (e.g., anonymized data).
